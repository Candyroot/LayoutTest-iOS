Future Plans
------------

Over time, we hope to add more features to the library and improve the API. Here's some of the big issues we are thinking about adding in the future:

  1. Allow for an option of random generators.
  2. Implement the 'smaller' protocol like Haskell and ScalaCheck to find the smallest possible failing case (instead of hundreds of failing cases).
